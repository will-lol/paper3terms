k-nearest neighbours algorithm is an algorithm that classifies a new point based on its feature similarity to other data points that have already been classified.

The points are mapped in a space of how many dimensions there are features. The distances between points are measured. k number of closest points to the new point are taken. The classification that has the highest number of points in this set is assigned to the new point.

### Examples
1. If k is 1, then the closest point’s classification is the new point’s classification
2. If k is 3 and the points’ classifications are such that 2 are classification one and 1 is classification two, then the new point is assigned to classification one.
