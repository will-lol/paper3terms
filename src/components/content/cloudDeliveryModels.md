## Infrastructure as a Service
Infrastructure as a Service is when you pay for cloud ‘primatives’ (as I like to call them):
- Compute
- Storage
- Network resources
## Platform as a Service
Platform as a Service simplifies the use of cloud privatives when deploying (mainly) applications. I’m using one right now! (Vercel). Examples:
- Google App Engine
- AWS Amplify
- Vercel
- Deno Deploy
- Cloudflare Workers
## Software as a Service
Software as a Service can be broadly described as software with a recurring revenue model that is centrally hosted.
Examples:
- Microsoft 365
- Google Workspace
