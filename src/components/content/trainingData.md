In machine learning, training data is the data that you train your machine learning model on. For example, the data may be pre-classified and you are training the model to classify it.

Training data is the opposite of testing data. Testing data is the data used to test a model. The data is kept seperate since the model, if trained and tested on the same data, may learn arbitrary correlations in the data and perform artificially well in testing. The model will not perform well in production however, since its correlations are not meaningful.
