There are various cloud deployment models.
## Public cloud
What most think of when we describe the cloud. You use public computers, pay by usage.
Think:
- AWS
- GCP
## Private cloud
In private cloud, you have sole ownership over hardware.
## Hybrid cloud
Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds to host an application. For example, Netflix may host its website in a public cloud but their content delivery networks on private hardware located within Internet Service Providers for minimum latency and maximum bandwidth for the most users.
## Multi cloud
Utilising many different public clouds. This is a popular model today. Although given the cloud space’s reliance on big cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), it could be argued that if you are using Vercel and AWS together, you aren’t using a multi-cloud approach because both clouds are running on the same hardware.
